## Watch the Growth of Specific Instagram #Hashtag

Visualizing Information Spreading through Instagram #Hashtags

## Description

Social media is currently the most efficient channel to spread a news or 
organize a campaign. Although we know that hashtag is now very popular around
the world, but we donâ€™t know how such popular hashtag topics growing from
a single original poster in a small region and finally with thousands
or millions of responses spreading throughout the world.

In this project we are focusing on visualization of the spreading of popular
Instagrams based on specific hashtag by using D3.
